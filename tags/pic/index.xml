      <description>Particle-based simulation of plasmas 1. Types of interacting systems 1.1 weakly/stronly interacting system Consider a system
Collection of charged ptcls. in a box box with the side of the $\lambda_D$ measure E-field at local pt. Strongly coupled system
If few particles exist,measurement would be very jumpy. As a ptcl passes by the detector, the measurement detects a jump up. When a ptcl moves away it detects a jump down. On avg, at any give time, very few ptcls are near the detector.</description>
